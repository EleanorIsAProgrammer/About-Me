    <p><em>a young woman who's on the way of achieving her dream.</em></p>
    <p>Hello everyone. My name is Eleanor, I'm studying Industrial Design at university in China.
        I'm also learning coding, and I love music. I plan to fully devote into making music in the future --
        after I've graduated successfully and become a programmer first!</p>

    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>I like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cappuccino" target="_blank">coffee</a>, I wouldn't say I like it sweet, but I don't like it totally bitter either,
            so no sugar but some milk please.</li>
        <li>And I like music, I love Freddie Mercury, I think he is the best songwriter,
            I hope in the future I can be as hard-working as him in terms of making music.</li>
        <li>Coding is also fine, sort of interesting.
            I think it's one of the most interesting jobs of all for making money.</li>
        <li>Cos I don't think I will do music totally for money, if I can't get much money out of it, 
            I will still be doing it. But I only like dedicated music, interesting and original chords and structures. 
            I hope there's enough efforts shown in it. That's why I adore Freddie, I adore him for his hard-workingness.
            I'm not a emotional person, I usually don't cry in music. 
            I think it's making a good thing, beautiful, interesting, and good, giving people pleasure.</li>
        <li>I also like having all kinds of fun, I'm gonna have the wildest parties when I'm wealthy and famous.</li>
    </ul>
